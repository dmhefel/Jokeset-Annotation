"A lady and her baby get on a bus. The bus driver looks at the lady, and then her baby, and then screams, "AHHHH! That 's the ugliest child I 've ever seen in my life! " The lady then, totally disgusted, marches up to the back of the bus to sit down. As she was sitting there absolutely furious, a man asks, "Are you ok, dear? " The lady replies, "I 'm so angry, that bus driver just insulted me. " The man says, "You go back up there and give that bus driver a piece of your mind, and I 'll watch your monkey. ""
