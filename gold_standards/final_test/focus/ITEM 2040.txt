"Three generals, one from the Army, one from the Air Force, and the third from the Marine Corps, were having a debate about whose soldiers were the bravest. To prove his point, the Air Force general calls over an airman: "Airman! Climb that flagpole, and once you are at the top, sing 'Wild Blue Yonder ', and then jump off! " "YES SIR! " replies the airman. He takes off for the flagpole like a shot, scales up it, sings the anthem, salutes and jumps off, hitting the ground at attention. The general dismisses him. "Now that 's bravery! " exclaims the general. "Bravery, nothing, " snorts the Army general. "Get over here, private! " "YES SIR!! " replies the private. "Put on full combat gear, load your rucksack with these rocks, scale that flagpole, come to attention, present arms, and sing the National Anthem, salute each of us, and then climb back down, head first. " "YES SIR!! " replies the private, and completes the task. "Now that is a brave man! Beat that!! " They look to the Marine. "Private, " the Marine Corps General commands. "YES SIR!! " "Put on full combat gear. Put these two dogs in your pack. Using only one hand, climb that flagpole. At the top, sing 'The Halls of Montezuma ', put your knife in your teeth, and dive off, headfirst. " The private snaps to attention, looks at the general and says, "TO HELL WITH YOU SIR!! " The general turns to the others and says, "Now THAT 'S bravery! ""
