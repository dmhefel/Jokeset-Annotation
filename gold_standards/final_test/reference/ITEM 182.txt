"A man walks into a drug store with his 8-year-old son. They happen to walk by the condom display, and the boy asks, "What are these, Dad? " The man matter-of-factly replies, "Those are called condoms, son. Men use them to have safe sex. " "Oh I see, " replied the boys pensively. "Yes, I 've heard of that in health class at school. " He looks over the display and picks up a package of three and asks, "Why are there three in this package. " The dad replies, "Those are for high-school boys. One for Friday, one for Saturday, and one for Sunday. " "Cool! " says the boy. He notices a pack of six and asks "Then who are these for? " "Those are for college men, " the dad answers, "Two for Friday, two for Saturday, and two for Sunday. " "WOW! " exclaimed the boy. "Then who uses these? " he asks, picking up a 12-pack. With a sigh, the dad replied, "Those are for married men. One for January, one for February, one for March. " one for March. ""
