"A guy walks into a bar and sits down. He orders six shots of vodka. The bartender asks the man, "Have a rough day? " The man replies, "Yeah, I found out my younger brother was gay! " The bartender says, "Man, I 'm sorry to hear that. That 's awful. " The man downs the shots and leaves. The very next day the same man comes back into the bar and orders six more shots of vodka. Bartender asks the man, "What 's wrong today? " The man replies, "I just found out my older brother is gay. " Bartender says, "Man, I 'm sorry to hear that. That 's terrible. " The man downs his shots and leaves. The man returns again on the third day and again orders six shots of vodka. Bartender asks the man, "Another rough day? " The man says, "Yeah. " The bartender asks the man, "Does anyone in your family like women?? " The man says, "Yeah, my wife. ""
