"Three dogs are at the vet in the waiting room. When the first dog asks the second dog what he 's in for, he answers, "My master bought a brand new carpet the other day, and at the first opportunity I soiled it, so now I 've been brought here to be put to sleep. So what are you here for? " The first dog replies grimly, "I 'm also being put to sleep. My master had a table with a collection of expensive vases and while I was chasing my tail I accidentally bumped into the table and broke them all. " The two dogs then look over and ask the third dog what he 's in for. The third dog answers, "The reason I 'm here is the other day my master stepped out of the shower and she bent over. I couldn 't resist, so I jumped her from behind and took her like a wild animal! " "So I guess you 're also here to be put to sleep? " says the first dog. The third dog answers, "Nope, I 'm here to get my nails clipped! ""
