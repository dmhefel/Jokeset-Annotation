"Little Josh comes home from first grade and tells his father that they learned about the history of Valentine 's Day. "Since Valentine 's Day is for a Christian saint and we 're Jewish, " he asks, "will God get mad at me for giving someone a valentine? " His father thinks a bit, then says, "No, I don 't think God would get mad. Who do you want to give a valentine to? " "Osama bin Laden, " David says. "Why Osama bin Laden, " his father asks in shock. "Well, " Josh says, "I thought that if a little American Jewish boy could have enough love to give Osama a valentine, he might start to think that maybe we 're not all bad, and maybe start loving people a little bit. And if other kids saw what I did and sent valentines to Osama, he 'd love everyone a lot. And then he 'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much he loved them and how he didn 't hate anyone anymore. " His father 's heart swells and he looks at his boy with newfound pride. "Josh, that 's the most wonderful thing I 've ever heard. " "I know, " Josh says, "and once that gets him out in the open, the Marines could blow the hell out of him. ""
