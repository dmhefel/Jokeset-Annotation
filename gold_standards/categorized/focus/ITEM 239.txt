"Morris and his wife Esther went to the state fair every year and every year Morris would say, "Esther, I 'd like to ride in that airplane. " Esther always replied, "I know Morris, but that airplane ride costs 50 dollars, and 50 dollars is 50 dollars. " One year Morris and Esther went to the fair and Morris said, "Esther, I 'm 85 years old. If I don 't ride that airplane I might never get another chance. " Esther replied, "Morris, that airplane ride costs 50 dollars, and 50 is dollars is 50 dollars. " The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I 'll make you a deal. I 'll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word, I won 't charge you; but if you say one word it 's 50 dollars. " Morris and Esther agreed and up they went. The pilot did all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word was heard. He did all his tricks over again, but still not a word. When they landed, the pilot turned to Morris and said, "By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn 't. " Morris replied, "Well, I was gonna say something when Esther fell out, but 50 dollars is 50 dollars. ""
