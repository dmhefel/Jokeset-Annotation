"A photographer, who was also a confirmed athiest, decided to go into the woods to get photos of the fall foliage. It was a beautiful day....fall colors, birds chirping, babbling brook, and a gentle breeze rustling the leaves.While snapping shots, the athiest heard a noise behind him, and whirled around to see a huge bear coming through the bushes.  He dropped his camera and ran. And kept running....... and looking behind him, he noticed the bear was gaining on him.  He was so scared that tears came to his eyes.  He ran faster, but the bear was closing in on him.  He ran faster yet, and tripped over a root.  Rolling over onto his back, the athiest saw the bear rise to his full height and raise a huge paw...... and the athiest cried out, "Oh, God, no! "And everything stopped.  The birds stopped chirping.  The brook stopped babbling.  The gentle breeze stopped.  And the bear froze with his paw in the air.  And the athiest heard a booming voice say, "Young man.  For years you doubted my very existance, but now that your life is in peril you call my name to help you.  Why should I do so? "And the athiest thought for a moment, and said, "Yes, you are right.  If you are God, then it would be hypocritical of me to become a Christian at this point in my life.  But, do you think that you could at least make the bear a Christian for today? "  And the booming voice was quiet for a moment and then said, "Done. "And everything started again.  The birds chirping, brook babbling, and gentle breeze rustling the leaves.  And the bear slowly lowered his paw.And the bear put his paws together, and bowed his massive head and said, "Dear Lord, please bless this food we are about to eat. ""
