"A drunk walks into a bar and says, "Bartender, buy everyone in the house a drink, pour yourself one, and give me the bill. " So, the bartender does just that, and hands the man the bill. The drunk says, "I haven 't got it. " The bartender slaps the guy around a few times then throws him out into the street. The very next day, the same drunk walks into the bar and once again says, "Bartender, buy everyone in the house a drink, pour yourself one, and give me the bill. " The bartender figures that he can 't possibly be stupid enough to pull the same trick twice, so he gives him the benefit of the doubt. He pours a round of drinks for the house, has a drink himself, and hands the drunk the bill. Again, the drunk says, "I haven 't got it. " The bartender can 't believe it. He picks the guy up, beats the living daylights out of him, then throws him out into the street. The next day, the same drunk walks back into the same bar and says, "Bartender, buy every one in the house a drink and give methe bill. " In disgust, the bartender says, "What, no drink for me this time? " The drunk replies, "Nope! You get too violent when you drink. ""
