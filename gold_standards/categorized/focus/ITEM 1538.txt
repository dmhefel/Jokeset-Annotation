At the end of the cavern you will find a red, sticky ball which is the egg. Address it and say, "I 'm a Sperm. " She will answer, "I 'm the Egg. " From that moment on you will work together to create the embryo. "Do you understand? " The sperm nodded affirmatively and the instructor said, "Then, good luck!

When he was near the entrance to the cavern, he looked back and saw he was far ahead. Then he was able to swim at a slower pace until he reached the red, sticky ball.When, at last, he reached the red, sticky ball, he brightened up, smiled and said "Hi, I 'm a sperm. "The red sticky ball smiled and said, "Hi, I 'm a tonsil. ""
