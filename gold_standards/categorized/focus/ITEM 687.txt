"A policeman pulls over a driver for swerving in and out of lanes on the highway. He tells the guy to blow a breath into a breathalyzer. "I can 't do that, officer. " "Why not? " "Because I 'm an asthmatic. I could get an asthma attack if I blow into that tube. " "Okay, we 'll just get a urine sample down at the station. " "Can 't do that either, officer. " "Why not? " "Because I 'm a diabetic. I could get low blood sugar if I pee in a cup. " "Alright, we could get a blood sample. " "Can 't do that either, officer. " "Why not? " "Because I 'm a hemophiliac. If I give blood I could die. " "Fine then, just walk this white line. " "Can 't do that either, officer. " "Why not? " "Because I 'm drunk. ""
