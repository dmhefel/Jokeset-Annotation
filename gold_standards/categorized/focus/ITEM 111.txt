"Two guys went to a gas station that was holding a contest: a chance to win free sex when you filled your tank. They pumped their gas and went to pay the attendant. "I 'm thinking of a number between one and ten, " he said. "If you guess right, you win free sex. " "Okay, " agreed one of the guys, "I guess seven. " "Sorry, I was thinking of eight, " replied the attendant. The next week they tried again. When they went to pay, the attendant told them to pick a number. "Two! " said the second guy. "Sorry, it 's three, said the attendant. "Come back and try again. " As they walked out to their car, one guy said to the other, "I think this contest is rigged. " "No way, " said his buddy. "My wife won twice last week. "
