"My uncle once spent days looking for his new hat. Finally, he decided that he 'd go to church on Sunday and sit at the back. During the service he would sneak out and grab a hat from the rack at the front door.On Sunday, he went to church and sat at the back. The sermon was about the 10 commandments. He sat through the whole sermon and instead of sneaking out he waited until the sermon was over and went to talk to the minister. "Father, I came here today to steal a hat to replace the one I lost. But after hearing your sermon on the 10 Commandments, I changed my mind. "The minister said, "Bless you my son. Was it when I started to preach thou shall not steal, that changed your heart? "My uncle responded, "No, it was the one on adultery. When you started to preach on that, I remembered where I left my hat. ""
