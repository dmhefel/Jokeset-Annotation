"A customer at Green 's Gourmet Grocery marveled at the proprietor 's quick wit and intelligence. "Tell me, Green, what makes you so smart? " "I wouldn 't share my secret with just anyone, " Green replies, lowering his voice so the other shoppers won 't hear. "But since you 're a good and faithful customer, I 'll let you in on it. Fish heads. You eat enough of them, you 'll be positively brilliant. " "You sell them here? " the customer asks. "Only $4 apiece, " says Green. The customer buys three. A week later, he 's back in the store complaining that the fish heads were disgusting and he isn 't any smarter. "You didn 't eat enough, " says Green. The customer goes home with 20 more fish heads. Two weeks later, he 's back and this time he 's really angry. "Hey, Green, " he says, "You 're selling me fish heads for $4 apiece when I can buy the whole fish for $2. You 're ripping me off! " "You see? " says Green. "You 're getting smarter already! ""
