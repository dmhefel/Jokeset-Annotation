"One day, two guys decide to take a drive to a local grocery store to get some lunch. On the way to the store they come to an intersection with a stoplight. The light showed red. The man driving went right through the red light. The passenger looked at the driver and screamed, "What the heck are you doing? You 're going to get us killed! " Then the driver responded, "Don 't worry, my mother always drives like this. " So later on, the two guys came to another stoplight and that too was red. The driver sped right through the light. Again the passenger looked at the driver and said, "I thought I told you, you 're gonna get us killed! Would you please stop this nonsense! " The driver looked at the passenger and responded, "All right! I get it but I told you My mother drives like this all the time! " Again, the two guys ran into another light. This time in was green. The Driver slammed on his breaks and stopped the car totally. "What the hell are you doing? " The passenger screamed. "This is the third time you almost got us killed. Why did you stop at a green light? " "Well, my mother might be coming the other way! "."
