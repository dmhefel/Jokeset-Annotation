"A young man was showing off his new sports car to his girlfriend. She was thrilled with the speed. "If I do 150mph will you take off your clothes? " he asked. "Yes " said the girl.When he got to 150mph, she peeled off her clothes. The boyfriend couldn 't keep his eyes on the road,and soon went off into the woods, crashing the car. She was flung clear of the wreckage, but he was stuckbetween the steering wheel and the seat. "Go and get help " he cried "But I can 't, I 'm naked and my clothes are gone " said the girl. "Take my shoe and cover your fanny Go quickly "She came up on a service station and said to the bloke behind the counter "Quick help me, my boyfriend 's stuck " The bloke looked at the shoe and said "There 's nothing I can do lady, he 's in way too far "
