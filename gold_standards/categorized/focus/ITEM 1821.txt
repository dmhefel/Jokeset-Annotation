"An Irishman was in the South of France and could not understand why Pierre had attracted so many girls on the beach and he had attracted no one. So he asked Pierre, "How do you manage to attract all the girls and I attract no one? " Pierre said, "Take a potato and tuck it in your swimming costume, it drives the women wild. " So the Irishman stuffed a potato in his costume and paraded up and down the beach. After a great many hours, however, he still failed to arouse a woman. So the Irishman went to see Pierre again and said, "I 've tried it Pierre, it doesn 't work! " Pierre took one look at the Irishman and said, "You might try putting the potato in the front of your bathing suit! ""
