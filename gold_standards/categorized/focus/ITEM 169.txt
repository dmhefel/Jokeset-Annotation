"Dan married one of a pair of identical twin girls. Less than a year later, he was in court filing for a divorce. "OK, " the judge said, "Tell the court why you want a divorce. " "Well, your honor, " Dan started, "Every once in a while my sister in law would come over for a visit, and because she and my wife are so identical looking, every once in a while I`d end up making love to her by mistake. " "Surely there must be some difference between the two women. " the judge said. "You`d better believe there is a difference, your honor. That`s why I want the divorce. " he replied."
