"Sam has been in the computer business for 25 years and is finally sick of the stress. He quits his job and buys 50 acres of land in Vermont as far from humanity as possible. Sam sees the postman once a week and gets groceries once a month. Otherwise it 's total peace and quiet. After six months or so of almost total isolation, he 's finishing dinner when someone knocks on his door. He opens it and there is a big, bearded Vermonter standing there. "Name 's Enoch... Your neighbor from four miles over the ridge... Having a party Saturday... Thought you 'd like to come. " "Great, " says Sam, "after six months of this I 'm ready to meet some local folks. Thank you. " As Enoch is leaving he stops, "Gotta warn you there 's gonna be some drinkin '. " "Not a problem... After 25 years in the computer business, I can drink with the best of 'em. "Again, as he starts to leave Enoch stops. "More 'n ' likely gonna be some fightin ' too. " "Damn ", Sam thinks... "Tough crowd. " "Well, I get along with people. I 'll be there. Thanks again. "Once again Enoch turns from the door. "I 've seen some wild sex at these parties, too. " "Now that 's not a problem " says Sam, "Remember I 've been alone for six months! I 'll definitely be there... By the way, what should I wear? "Enoch stops in the door again and says, "Whatever you want, just gonna be the two of us. ""
