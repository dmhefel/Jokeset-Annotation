"A woman walked up to a little old man rocking in a chair on his porch. "I couldn 't help noticing how happy you look, " she said. "What 's your secret for a long happy life? " "I smoke three packs of cigarettes a day, " he said. "I also drink a case of whiskey a week, eat fatty foods, and never exercise. " "That 's amazing, " the woman said. "How old are you? " "Twenty-six, " he said."
