"A guy walks into a bar and says to the bartender, "I want you to give me 12-year scotch, and don 't try to fool me because I can tell the difference. "The bartender is skeptical and decides to try to trick the man with 5-year scotch. The man takes a sip, scowls and says, "Bartender, this crap is 5-year scotch. I told you I want 12-year scotch. " The bartender tries once more with 8-year scotch. The man takes a sip, grimaces and says, "Bartender, I don 't want 8-year scotch like this filth. Give me 12-year scotch! "Impressed, the bartender gets the 12-year scotch, the man takes a sip and sighs, "Ah, now that 's the real thing. " A disgusting, grimy, stinking drunk has been watching all this with great interest. He stumbles over and sets a glass down in front of the man and says, "Hey, I think that 's really far out what you can do. Try this one. "The man takes a sip and immediately spits out the liquid and cries, "Yechhh! This stuff tastes like piss! " The drunk 's eyes light up and he says, "Yeah, now how old am I? ""
