"A drunk walks into a bar, sits down and demands a drink. "Get out " says the bartender. "I don 't serve drunks here ". The drunk staggers out the front door, only to come back in through the side door. He sits at the bar, bangs his fist and demands a drink. "I just told you to get out, didn 't I? Now LEAVE! ". The drunk gets off his stool, stumbles out the side door and, comes back inside through the back door. Once again, he sits at the bar and loudly asks for a drink. The bartender, now glowing mad, looks at the drunk and yells "I TOLD YOU, NO DRUNKS ALLOWED, NOW GET OUT!!! ". The drunk looks up at the bartender and slurs "How many bars do you work at, anyway? "."
