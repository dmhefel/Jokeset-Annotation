"Bob was excited about his new rifle and decided to try bear hunting.  He traveled up to Alaska, spotted  a small brown bear and shot it.  Soon after there  was a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to  see a big black bear.       The black bear said, "That was a very bad mistake.  That was my cousin. I 'm going to give you two choices.  Either I maul you to death or we have sex. "     After considering briefly, Bob decided to accept the latter alternative.  So the black bear had his way with  Bob. Even though he felt sore for two weeks, Bob soon recovered and vowed revenge.  He headed out on another trip to Alaska where he found the black bear and shot it dead.  Right after, there was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him.    The grizzly said, "That was a big mistake, Bob.  That was my cousin and you 've got two choices: Either I maul you to death or I have sex with you. " Again, Bob thought it was better to cooperate with the grizzly bear than be mauled to death.  So the grizzly had his way with Bob.      Although he survived, it took several months before Bob fully recovered.  Now Bob was completely outraged, so he headed back to Alaska and managed to track down the grizzly bear and shoot it.  He felt sweet revenge, but then, moments later, there was a tap on his shoulder.  He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there. The polar bear looked at him and said, "Admit it Bob, you don 't come here for the hunting, do you? ""
