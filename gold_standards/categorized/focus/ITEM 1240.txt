"An out-of-towner drove his car into a ditch in a very rural  area. Luckily, Farmer Jones came to help with his big  strong horse named Hobo . . . He hitched ole Hobo up to the car and yelled, "Pull, Nellie,  pull! " Hobo didn 't move a muscle... just flicked away a fly  with his tail.Then Jones hollered out, "C 'mon, pull, Davey, pull! " Again, ole Hobo didn 't move.Once more the farmer commanded, "Pull, Stetson, pull! " Nothing from Hobo.Then the farmer nonchalantly said, "Pull, Hobo. C 'mon, boy, pull! "  And the horse easily dragged the car up, out of the ditch.The motorist was most appreciative and very curious. He asked the farmer why he called his horse by the wrong name three times in a  row.Wise Farmer Jones answered, "Well, ole, Hobo here is blind as a bat. If he thought he was the only one pulling, he wouldn 't even try! "
