"A little girl is sitting on her grandpa 's lap and studying the wrinkles on his old face. She gets up the nerve to rub her fingers over the wrinkles. Then she touches her own face and looks more puzzled. Finally the little girl asks, "Grandpa, did God make you? " "He sure did honey, a long time ago, " replies her grandpa. "Well, did God make me? " asks the little girl. "Yes, He did, and that wasn 't too long ago, " answers her grandpa. "Boy, " says the little girl, "He 's sure doing a lot better job these days isn 't He? ""
