"A man and a woman who have never met before find themselves in the same sleeping carriage of a train.After the initial embarrassment, they both go to sleep, the woman on the lower bunk, the man on the top.In the middle of the night the man leans over and says, "I 'm sorry to bother you but I 'm cold and I was wondering if you could possibly pass me another blanket. "The woman leans out and says in a sexy voice, "I 've got a better idea. Let 's pretend we 're married. " "Hey, terrific idea! " says the eager man. "Good! " she replies, "Get your own fuckin ' blanket! ""
