"One day, after striking gold in Alaska, a lonesome miner came down from the mountains and walked into a saloon in the nearest town.   "I 'm lookin ' for the meanest, roughest and toughest whore in the Yukon! " he said to the bartender.   "We got her! " replied the barkeeper.   "She 's upstairs in the second room on the right. " The miner handed the bartender a gold nugget to pay for the whore and two beers.  He grabbed the bottles, stomped up the stairs, kicked open the second door on the right and yelled, "I 'm lookin ' for the meanest, roughest and toughest whore in the Yukon! " The woman inside the room looked at the miner and said, "You found her! " Then she stripped naked, bent over and grabbed her ankles.   "How do you know I want to do it in that position? " asked the miner. "I don 't, " replied the whore, "but I thought you might like to open those beers first. ""
