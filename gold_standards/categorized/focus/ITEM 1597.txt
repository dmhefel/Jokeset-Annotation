"Harold is 82 and having some prostate problems.After examining him, the doctor gives him a specimen jar and says, "Take this home with you, and try toproduce a semen specimen. Stop by tomorrow and drop it off so I can run a few tests. "Harold takes the jar and heads home.The next day, Harold comes in and asks to speak with the doctor.When he is taken into the office, the doctor asks how hemade out. "Not good, Doc. " Says Harold. "I went home and tried to do what you said. I tried with my right hand 'til it was cramped from the arthritis...no luck. I tried with my left hand, until I had blisters...still no luck. "Then I asked my wife to help me out, so she tried with her left hand and then with her right hand...no luck. She even tried with her mouth. She tried with her teeth in, and she tried with her teeth out...still no luck. "Then we called Edna, next door, to see if she could help... " "Good Grief man! " exclaimed the doctor, "You asked your next door neighbour to help you? " "Yep. " Says Harold, "Couldn 't none of us get the lid off that jar. ""
