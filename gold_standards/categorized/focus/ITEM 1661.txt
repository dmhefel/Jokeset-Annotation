"Shame And Glory:A woman walks into a bar and orders two shots. She downs the first one "This is for the shame ", and then the second one "This is for the  glory. "  She then orders two more shots. She drinks the first one "This is for the shame " and then the second one "This is for the glory. "  She is about to order two more shots when the bartender stops her. "Ma 'am, I was just wondering ... what 's this shame and glory about? "   "Well, " she replies, "I like to do my housework naked. But when I bent over to pick something up, my Great Dane mounted me from behind. "   "That must be the shame, " the bartender said. "No, that was the glory. The shame is when we got locked together and  he dragged me around the front yard for thirty minutes. ""
