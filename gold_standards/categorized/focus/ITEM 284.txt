"An avid golfer dies and goes to heaven. He is met by St. Peter who tells him, "Welcome to Heaven. I know you will be pleased to know that this is the best golf course in the universe! " The man 's eyes turn cloudy. St. Peter says, "And the weather here is always good. " A tear begins to form in the man 's eye. St. Peter says, "And there is never any lines of people when you want to golf. " A tear starts dropping from the man 's other eye. St. Peter hurriedly says, "And your drives go at least 50 yards further up here. " The man is now sniffling. St. Peter then says, "And you will never have more than two puts on any of the greens. " The man is now sobbing uncontrollably. St. Peter asks, "Hey, what is the matter with you? I thought you would be overjoyed. Why the tears? " The man answers, "If my wife hadn 't fed me all of that healthy food, I would have been here five years earlier! "."
