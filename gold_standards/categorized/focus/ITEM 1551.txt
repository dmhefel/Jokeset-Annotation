"An Irish guy gets home early from work and hears strange noises coming from the bedroom. He rushes upstairs to find his wife naked on the bed, sweating and panting. "What 's up ? " he says. "I 'm having a heart attack ", cries the woman. He rushes downstairs to grab the phone, but just as he 's dialling, his 4 year old son comes up and says, "Daddy, Daddy, Uncle Mick 's hiding in your wardrobe and he 's got no clothes on ! " The guy slams down the phone and storms upstairs into the bedroom past his screaming wife and rips open the wardrobe door. Sure enough, there 's his brother, totally naked cowering on the wardrobe floor. "You bastard ", says the husband, "my wife 's having a heart attack and you 're running around with no clothes on scaring the kids! ""
