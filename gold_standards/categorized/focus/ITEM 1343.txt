"After a long day at the office, Chris came home one day to find his dog with the neighbor 's pet rabbit in his mouth.The rabbit was obviously dead. Chris panicked! "If my neighbors find out my dog killed their bunny, they 'll hate me forever, " he thought.So he took the dirty, chewed up rabbit into the house, gave it a bath and blow-dried its fur.Chris knew his neighbors kept their backdoor open during the summer, so he snuck inside and put the bunny back into the cage, hoping his neighbors would think it died of natural causes.A couple of days later Chris and his neighbor saw each other outside. "Did you hear that Fluffy died? " the neighbor asked. "Oh. Uhmm... Sorry to hear that. What happened? " Chris mumbled.The neighbor replied: "We just found him dead in his cage one day. But the strange thing is that the day after we buried him, we went out to dinner and someone must have dug him up, gave him a bath and put him back into the cage! There are some really sick people out there! ""
