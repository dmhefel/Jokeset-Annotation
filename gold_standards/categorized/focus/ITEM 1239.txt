"A mature woman goes to the doctor and asks his help to revive her  man 's sex drive. "What about trying Viagra? " asks the doctor. "Not a chance, " says Mrs. Murphy. "He won't even take an aspirin for  a headache. " "No problem " replies the doctor. "Drop it into his coffee; he won 't  even taste it. Try it and come back in a week to let me know how you got  on. " A week later, Mrs. Murphy visits the doctor, and he inquires as to  how things went. "Oh, it was terrible, just terrible, doctor. " "What happened? " asks the doctor. "Well, I did as you advised and slipped it in his coffee. The effect  was immediate. He jumped straight up, swept the cutlery off the table, at  the same time ripping my clothes off, and then proceeded to make passionate  love to me on the tabletop. It was terrible. " "What 's terrible? " asked the doctor. "Was the sex not good? " "Oh no, doctor, the sex was the best I 've had in 25 years, but I 'll  never be able to show my face in McDonald 's again. "
