"Two hunters were off on their annual trip to the Canadian wilderness to bag a moose. As the seaplane landed on a lake in a remote area, the pilot said, "I 'll be back in one week to pick you up. But only one moose, please. " When he returned to the lake, he found the hunters proudly standing beside two moose. "I told you guys only one moose! " the furious flier screamed. "There 's no way the plane can take off with that much weight! " "You 're just a chicken pilot, " one hunter said. "We killed two moose last year and that pilot wasn 't afraid to take off. " Stung by the suggestion of cowardice, he reconsidered. "All right, if you did it last year, I guess we can try it. " They loaded up and the pilot taxied to the far end of the lake to begin his take-off. The plane bounced across the water as it strained to get airborne, but the overloaded aircraft finally ran out of space and crashed into the trees. Some time later, the hunters regained consciousness. "Where are we? " one asked. His friend looked around at the scattered debris, then back at the edge of the lake and replied, "Oh, I guess about a hundred yards farther than last year. ""
