"Lawyer 's are jerks " the man said as he completed his story.His colleague agreed by saying, "Yeah, lawyers are jerks ".A couple nearby overheard the conversation and the word spread quickly throughout the bar that indeed lawyers are jerks. At the far end of the bar, a well dressed gentleman finally caught wind of the topic of conversation. He stood up slammed his beer down on the counter and proclaimed to the whole bar that he was extremely offended by the conversation and that he would appreciate it if whoever started this would stand up and apologize in front of the entire crowd.The gentleman, who originally claimed, "lawyers are jerks ", angrily stood up and said, "You must be an attorney ".The offended gentleman quickly replied, "No kind sir, I am an jerk.
