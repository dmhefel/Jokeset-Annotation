"One morning a man came into the church on crutches. He stopped in front of the holy water, put some on both legs, and then threw away his crutches. An alter boy witnessed the scene and then ran into the rectory to tell the priest what he 'd just seen. "Son, you 've just witnessed a miracle, " the priest said. "Tell me where is this man now? " "Flat on his butt over by the holy water, " said the boy."
