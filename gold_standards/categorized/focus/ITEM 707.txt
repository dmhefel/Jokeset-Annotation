"Once there was a man who every week bought a lottery ticket in the local liquor store.  He really didn 't expect to win until one day he jumped in joy when he found out that he won 30 million dollars.  The man immidiatly ran to his car, drove home at full speed, pulled up the drive way, ran inside the house slamed the front door behind him.  As soon as he saw his wife, he said "Honey, I 've won the lottery so pack your bags!!! "  The man 's wife leaping in joy asked him; "What should I pack for?, for hiking, mountain climbing or sun bathing honey!? " "For what ever you want, Just make sure you 're out by the end of the week!!! ""
