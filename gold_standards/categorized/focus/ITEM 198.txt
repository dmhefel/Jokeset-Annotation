"In a Poor town in the middle of nowhere and no women, A guy walks into a bar and asks the bartender, "How can you live in this town without any women? ". The bartender replies, "It 's not that bad, sir, when we get lonely we go out back where there is a barrel with a knothole in it. It never sounds appeasing at first, but after one try you 're hooked. "So after a few beers, the guy starts getting a little lonely and tells the bartender he 's gonna go find the barrel.At that, he walks up to the barrel and sticks it in the knothole.After about 5 minutes he ventures back to the bar and tells the bartender, "Man, that 's the greatest stuff I 've ever had!! What do I owe ya? ".To which the bartender replies, "Nothing, but it 's your turn to get in the barrel "."
