"There was a guy who walked into a bar and said to the bartender, "I 'll bet you a beer that I can bite my left eye. " And the bartender said, Well, nobody can bite their own eye! Sure. " So the man took out a glass eye and bit it. So he got his free beer from the bartender who had just lost the bet. Then he said, "I 'll bet you another beer I can bite my right eye. " And the bartender replied, "No one can have two glass eyes. Sure thing, Sir. " So the man took out false teeth and bit his left eye."
