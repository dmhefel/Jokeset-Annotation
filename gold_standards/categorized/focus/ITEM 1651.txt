"The woman, wanting to get in on the conversation remarked, "Ah, Mozart. You 're so right. It was just this morning that I saw him getting on the No. 5 bus going to South Padre Island.

"In the car on the way home the wife turned to the husband and said, "You 're really mad about something aren 't you? " "How could you tell? My goodness! I 've never been so embarrassed in my life!
