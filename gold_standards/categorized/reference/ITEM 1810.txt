"President Clinton and the Pope died on the same day, and due to an administrative foul up, Clinton was sent to heaven and the Pope was sent to hell. The Pope explained the situation to the devil, he checked out all of the paperwork, and the error was acknowledged. The Pope was told, however, that it would take about 24 hours to fix the problem and correct the error. The next day, the Pope was called in and the devil said his good-byes as he went off to heaven. On his way up, he met Clinton who was on his way down. They stopped to chat. "Sorry about the mix up " says the Pope. "No problem, " replies Clinton. "Well, I 'm really excited about going to heaven. " Clinton asks, "Why 's that? " "Well, I 've always wanted to meet the Virgin Mary. "President Clinton replies, "you 're a day late "."
