"Bill and Hillary Clinton were traveling to Hillary 's high school reunion in Chicago when they had to stop for gas. They pulled up to the full-service pump and waited as the gas station attendant came out to fill up the limo. As he was pumping the gas, Hillary said to Bill, "Gee, that guy looks so familiar! " A few minutes later, it hit her. "Bill! " she said, "I do know that guy! We used to date in high school! "Bill turned to Hillary and said, "Well, aren 't you glad you ended up with me? " "Why? " asked Hillary. "Because I 'm the President of the United States and he 's pumping gas! " "Well, " said Hillary, "If I had married him, he 'd be President! "
