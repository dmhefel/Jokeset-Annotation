"A man is out shopping and discovers a new brand of Olympic condoms. Clearly impressed, he buys a pack. Upon getting home he announces to his wife the purchase he just made. 'Olympic condoms? ', she blurts, 'What makes them so special? ' 'There are three colours ', he replies, 'Gold, Silver and Bronze. ' 'What colour are you going to wear tonight? ', she asks cheekily. 'Gold of course ', says the man proudly. The wife responds, 'Really, why don 't you wear Silver: it would be nice if you came second for a change! '."
