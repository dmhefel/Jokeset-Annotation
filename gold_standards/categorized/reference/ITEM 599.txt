"A nun, really needing to go to the bathroom, walked into a local Hooters. The place was hopping with music and dancing, but every once in a while the lights would turn off. Each time after the lights would go out, the place would erupt into cheers. However, when the revelers saw the nun, the room went dead silent. She walked up to the bartender, and asked, "May I please use the restroom? The bartender replied, "I really don 't think you should.. " "Why not? " the nun asked. "Well, there is a statue of a naked man in there, and his most private parts are covered only by a fig leaf. " "Nonsense, " said the nun, "I 'll just look the other way. " So, the bartender showed the nun the door at the top of the stairs, and she preceded to the restroom. After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and dancing again. However, they did stop just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause. She went to the bartender and said, "Sir, I don 't understand. Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom? " "Well, now they know you 're one of us, " said the bartender, "Would you like a drink? " "But, I still don 't understand, " said the puzzled nun. "You see, " laughed the bartender, "every time the fig leaf on the statue is lifted up, the lights go out in the whole place. Now, how about that drink? ""
