"A man with a winking problem is applying for a position as a sales representative for a large firm. The interviewer looks over his papers and says, "This is phenomenal. You 've graduated from the best schools; your recommendations are wonderful, and your experience is unparalleled. Normally, we 'd hire you without a second thought. However, a sales representative has a highly visible position, and we 're afraid that your constant winking will scare off potential customers. I 'm sorry...we can 't hire you. " "But wait, " he said. "If I take two aspirin, I 'll stop winking! " "Really? Great! Show me! " So the applicant reaches into his jacket pocket and begins pulling out all sorts of condoms: red condoms, blue condoms, ribbed condoms, flavored condoms; finally, at the bottom, he finds a packet of aspirin. He tears it open, swallows the pills, and stops winking. "Well, " said the interviewer, "that 's all well and good, but this is a respectable company, and we will not have our employees womanizing all over the country! " "Womanizing? What do you mean? I 'm a happily married man! " "Well then, how do you explain all these condoms? " "Oh, that, " he sighed. "Have you ever walked into a pharmacy, winking, and asked for aspirin? ""
