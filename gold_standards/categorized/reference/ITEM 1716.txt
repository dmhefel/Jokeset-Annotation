"The Pope, Billy Graham, and Oral Roberts were in a three-way plane crash over the Atlantic Ocean. Tragically, they all died and went to the Pearly Gates together. "Oh, this is terrible, " exclaims St. Peter, "I know you guys think we summoned you here, but this is just one of those coincidences that happen. St. Peter was fretting, "Since we weren 't expecting you, your quarters just aren 't ready. We can 't take you in just yet and we can 't send you back. " Then he got an idea. He picked up the phone, "Lucifer, this is Pete. Hey, I got these three guys up here. They 're ours, but we weren 't expecting them, and we gotta fix the place up for 'em. I was hoping you could put them up for a while. It 'll only be a couple of days. I 'll owe you one. " Reluctantly, the Devil agreed. Two days later... "Pete, this is Lucifer. Hey you gotta come get these three clowns. This Pope guy is forgiving everybody, the Graham fellow is saving everybody, and Oral Roberts has raised enough money to buy air conditioning! ""
