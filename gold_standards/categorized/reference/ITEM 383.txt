"Recently a "Husband Super Store " opened where women could go to choose a husband from among many men. It was laid out in five floors. The only rule was, once you opened the door to any floor, you HAD to choose a man from that floor; if you went up a floor, you couldn 't go back down except to leave the place, never to return. A couple of girlfriends went to the shopping center to find some husbands... First floor The door had a sign saying, "These men have jobs and love kids. " The women read the sign and said, "Well, that 's better than not having a job or not loving kids, but I wonder what 's further up? " So up they went. Second floor The sign read, "These men have high paying jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking. " "Hmmm, " said the ladies, "But, I wonder what 's further up? " Third floor This sign read, "These men have high paying jobs, are extremely good looking, love kids and help with the housework. " "Wow, " said the women, "Very tempting. " But there was another floor, so further up they went. Fourth floor This door had a sign saying "These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak. " "Oh, mercy me, " they cried, "Just think what must be awaiting us further on! So up to the fifth floor they went. Fifth floor The sign on that door said, "This floor is empty and exists only to prove that women are impossible to please. The exit is to your left. "
