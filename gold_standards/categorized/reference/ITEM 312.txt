"The first grade class gathered around the teacher for a game of "Guess the Animal ".  The first picture the teacher held up was of a cat.   "Okay, boys and girls, " she said brightly, "can anyone tell me what this is? "   "I know, I know, it 's a cat! "  yelled a little boy. "Very good, Eddie.  Now, who knows what this animal is called? "   "That 's a dog! " piped up the same little boy. "Right, again.  And what about this animal? " she asked, holding up a picture of a deer.Silence fell over the class.  After a minute or two, the teacher said, "I 'll give you a hint, children...it 's something you 're mother calls your father ". "I know, I know, " screamed Eddie.  It 's a horny bastard! ""
