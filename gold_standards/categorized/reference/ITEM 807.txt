"After a few days on the new Earth, the Lord called to Adam and said, ' 'It is time for you and Eve to begin the process of populating the earth, so I want you to kiss her. ' ' Adam answered, ' 'Yes, Lord, but what is a 'kiss '? ' ' The Lord gave a brief description to Adam, who took Eve by the hand and took her to a nearby bush. A few minutes later, Adam emerged and said, ' 'Thank you Lord, that was enjoyable. ' ' And the Lord replied, ' 'Yes Adam, I thought you might enjoy that. Now, I 'd like you to caress Eve. ' ' And Adam said, ' 'What is a 'caress '? ' ' So, the Lord again gave Adam a brief description and Adam went behind the bush with Eve. Quite a few minutes later, Adam returned, smiling, and said, ' 'Lord, that was even better than the kiss. ' ' And the Lord said, ' 'You 've done well Adam. And now, I want you to make love to Eve. ' ' And Adam asked, ' 'What is 'make love ', Lord? ' ' So, the Lord again gave Adam directions and Adam went again to Eve behind the bush, but this time he re-appeared in two seconds. And Adam said, ' 'Lord, what is a 'headache '? ' '"
