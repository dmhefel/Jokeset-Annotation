"Initially, he doesn 't want to give the job to this man, but his conscience got the better of him. He decided to try him out.After three weeks, the manager is looking at the sales figures and realizes that the new guy is selling the most copies. Amazed, he calls him in to his office. "You 've only worked here for three weeks and you 've already sold more copies than anyone else here! How do you do it?
