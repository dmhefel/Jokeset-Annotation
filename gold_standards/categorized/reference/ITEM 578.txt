One day, down in the mystical forest, a magical frog was hopping towards a water hole. The forest was so enormous that the frog had never laid eyes on another animal before. But today, by chance a bear was chasing after a rabbit to have for dinner. The frog called for the two to stop and said, “Because you are the only two animals I have seen, I will grant both of you three wishes. Bear, you can go first.” The bear thought for a moment, and being the male he was, said, “I wish for all the bears in this forest, apart from me, to be female.” For his wish, the rabbit asked for a crash helmet, and immediately put it on. The bear was amazed at the stupidity of the rabbit, wasting his wish like that. It was the bear’s second turn for a wish. “Well, I wish that all the bears in the next forest were female as well.” The rabbit asked for a motorcycle and immediately hopped on it and roared the engine. The bear was shocked that the rabbit was asking for such idiotic items, because after all, he could have asked for money and bought the bike. For the last wish the bear thought for a while and then said, “I wish that all the bears in the world, apart from me, were female.” The rabbit grinned, roared the engine, and said, “I wish that the bear was gay.”
