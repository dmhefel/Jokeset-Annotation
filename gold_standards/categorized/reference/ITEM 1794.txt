"Two deaf men were talking on their coffee break, about being out late the night before. The first man said, " My wife was asleep when I got home, so I was able to sneak into bed, and not get into trouble. " The second deaf man said, " Boy you 're lucky. My wife was wide awake, waiting for me in bed, and she started swearing at me and giving me hell for being out so late. " The first deaf man asked, " So what did you do? " "I turned out the light, " the second man replied."
