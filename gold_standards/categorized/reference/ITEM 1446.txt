"Two women came before wise King Solomon, dragging between them a young man in a three-piece suit. "This young lawyer agreed to marry my daughter, " said one. "No! He agreed to marry MY daughter, " said the other.And so they haggled before the King until he called for silence. "Bring me my biggest sword, " said Solomon, "and I shall hew the young attorney in half. Each of you shall receive a half. " "Sounds good to me, " said the first lady.But the other woman said, "Oh Sire, do not spill innocent blood. Let the other woman 's daughter marry him. "The wise king did not hesitate a moment. "The attorney must marry the first lady 's daughter, " he proclaimed. "But she was willing to hew him in two! " exclaimed the king 's court. "Indeed, " said wise King Solomon. "That shows she is the TRUE mother-in-law. ""
