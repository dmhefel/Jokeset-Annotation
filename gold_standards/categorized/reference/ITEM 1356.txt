"The distinguished professor and his chauffeur were talking one day on the way to the next speaking engagement, and the driver said, "I 've sat in the back and listened to your presentation so many times that I can give it just as well as you can. "The professor said "I 'll bet you can 't. Just to prove it, we 'll trade clothes in the hotel, and I 'll sit in the back. "The chauffeur delivered the lecture flawlessly, and the audience applauded him roundly. Then a pompous professor from the local university, wishing to impress his colleagues in the audience, stood and asked a very specific question concerning the driver 's presentation.The driver said, "I am amazed that you would ask such a silly question. The answer is so obvious that I am going to ask my chauffeur, who is sitting in the back, to answer your ridiculous question. ""
