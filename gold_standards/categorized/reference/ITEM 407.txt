"Sitting on the side of the highway waiting to catch speeding drivers, a State Police Officer sees a car puttering along at 22 MPH. He thinks to himself, "This driver is just as dangerous as a speeder! " So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over.Approaching the car, he notices that there are five old ladies -- two in the front seat and three in the back - eyes wide and white as ghosts.The driver, obviously confused, says to him, "Officer, I don 't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems to be the problem? " "Ma 'am, " the officer replies, "You weren 't speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers. " "Slower than the speed limit? " she asked. No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly... Twenty-Two miles an hour! " the old woman says a bit proudly. The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that "22 " was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error. "But before I let you go, Ma 'am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car ok? These women seem awfully shaken and they haven 't muttered a single peep this whole time. " the officer asks. "Oh, they 'll be alright in a minute officer. We just got off Route 119. ""
