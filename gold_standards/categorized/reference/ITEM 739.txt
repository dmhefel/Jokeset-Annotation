"A man in Phoenix calls his son in New York the day beforeThanksgiving and says, "I hate to ruin your day, but I have to tell you that your mother and I are divorcing; forty-five years of misery is enough. "   "Pop, what are you talking about? " the son screams.   "We can 't stand the sight of each other any longer, " the father says. "We 're sick of each other, and I 'm sick of talking about this, so you call your sister in Chicago and tell her. " Frantic, the son calls his sister, who explodes on the phone. "Like hell they 're getting divorced, " she shouts, "I 'll take care of this, " She calls Phoenix immediately, and screams at her father, "You are NOT getting divorced. Don 't do a single thing until I get there. I 'm calling my brother back, and we 'll both be there tomorrow. Until then, don 't do a thing, DO YOU HEAR ME? " and hangs up. The old man hangs up his phone and turns to his wife. "Okay, " hesays, "they 're coming for Thanksgiving and paying their own way. ""
