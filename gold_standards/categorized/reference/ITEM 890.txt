"A mid-level executive was so frustrated at being passed over for promotion year after year, that, in frustration, he went to a brain-transplant center in the hope of raising his I.Q. 20 points.After a battery of physical and psychological tests, he was told by the center 's director that he was an acceptable candidate. "That 's great! " the executive said. "But I understand that this procedure can be really expensive. " "Yes, sir, it can, " the director replied. "An ounce of accountant 's brain for example, costs one thousand dollars; an ounce of an economist 's brain costs two thousand; an ounce of a corporate president 's is forty-five thousand. An ounce of a Democrat 's brain is seventy-five thousand dollars. " "Seventy-five thousand dollars for an ounce of a Democrat 's brain? Why on earth is that? " "Do you have any idea, " the director asked, "how many Democrats we would have to kill? "
