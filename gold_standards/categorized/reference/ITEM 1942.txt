"One Sunday afternoon, a guy walks into a bar with his pet dog. The bartender said, "Sorry, pal. No pets allowed. " The man replied, "This is a special dog. Turn on the Jets game and you 'll see. " The bartender, anxious to see what will happen, turned on the game. The guy said, "Watch. Whenever the Jets score, my dog does flips. " The Jets keep scoring field goals and the dog keeps flipping and jumping. "Wow! That 's one hell of a dog you got there. What happens when the Jets score a touchdown? " asked the bartender. The man replied, "I don 't know. I 've only had him for seven years. ""
