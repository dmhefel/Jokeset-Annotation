"A man died and went to heaven. As he stood in front of St. Peter at the Pearly Gates, he saw a huge wall of clocks behind him. He asked, "What are all those clocks? " St. Peter answered, "Those are Lie-Clocks. Everyone on Earth has a Lie-Clock. Every time you lie the hands on your clock will move. " "Oh, " said the man, "Whose clock is that? " "That 's Mother Teresa 's. The hands have never moved, indicating that she never told a lie. " "Incredible, " said the man. "And whose clock is that one? " St. Peter responded, "That 's Abraham Lincoln 's clock. The hands have moved twice, telling us that Abe told only two lies in his entire life. " "Where 's George Bush 's clock? " asked the man. "Bush 's clock is in Jesus ' office. He 's using it as a ceiling fan. ""
