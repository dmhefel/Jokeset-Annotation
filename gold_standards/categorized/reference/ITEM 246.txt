"An old man in Mississippi was sitting on his front porch watching the sun rise. He sees the neighbor 's kid walk by carrying something big under his arm. He yells out "Hey boy, whatcha got there? " The boy yells back "Roll of chicken wire. " The old man says "What you gonna do with that? " The boy says "Gonna catch some chickens. " The old man yells "You damn fool, you can 't catch chickens with chicken wire! " The boy just laughs and keeps walking. That evening at sunset the boy comes walking by and to the old man 's surprise he is dragging behind him the chicken wire with about 30 chickens caught in it. Same time next morning the old man is out watching the sun rise and he sees the boy walk by carrying something kind of round in his hand. The old man yells out "Hey boy, whatcha got there? " The boy yells back "Roll of duck tape. " The old man says "What you gonna do with that? " The boy says back "Gonna catch me some ducks. " The old man yells back, "You damn fool, you can 't catch ducks with duck tape! " The boy just laughs and keeps walking. That night around sunset the boy walks by coming home and to the old man 's amazement he is trailing behind him the unrolled roll of duck tape with about 35 ducks caught in it. Same time next morning the old man sees the boy walking by carrying what looks like a long reed with something fuzzy on the end. The old man says "Hey boy, whatcha got there? " The boy says "It 's a pussy willow. " The old man says "Wait up.... I 'll get my hat "."
