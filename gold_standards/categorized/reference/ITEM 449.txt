"A man is in a hotel lobby. He wants to ask the clerk a question. As he turns to go to the front desk, he accidentally bumps into a woman beside him and as he does, his elbow goes into her breast. They are both quite startled. The man turns to her and says, "Ma 'm, if your heart is as soft as your breast, I know you 'll forgive me. " She replies, "if your member is as hard as your elbow, I 'm in room 436. ""
