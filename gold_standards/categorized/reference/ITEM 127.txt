"There was a lawyer and he was just waking up from anesthesia after surgery, and his wife was sitting by his side. His eyes fluttered open and he said, "You 're beautiful! " and then he fell asleep again. His wife had never heard him say that so she stayed by his side. A couple minutes later his eyes fluttered open and he said "You 're cute! " Well, the wife was dissapointed because instead of "beautiful " it was "cute. " She said "What happened to 'beautiful '? " His reply was "The drugs are wearing off! "
