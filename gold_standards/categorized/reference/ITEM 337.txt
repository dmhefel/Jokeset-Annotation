"Two little kids, aged six and eight, decide it 's time to learn how to swear. So, the eight-year-old says to the six-year-old, "Okay, you say 'damn ' and I 'll say 'hell ' ". All excited about their plan, they troop downstairs, where their mother asks them what they 'd like for breakfast. "Aw, hell, " says the eight-year-old, "gimme some Cheerios. " His mother backhands him off the stool, sending him bawling out of the room, and turns to the younger brother. "What 'll you have? " "I dunno, " quavers the six-year-old, "but you can damn sure bet it ain 't gonna be Cheerios. ""
