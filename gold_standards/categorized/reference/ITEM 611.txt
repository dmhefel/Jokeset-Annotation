"Three men were lost in the forest and later captured by cannibals. The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could live if they passed a trial. The first step of the trial was to go to the forest with the cannibals and get 10 pieces of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather some. The first man came back and said to the king, "I brought ten apples. " The king then explained the second step of the trial to him. First, he had to shove the fruits up his butt without any expression on his face, or he would be eaten. The first apple went in, but when he tried the second one he winced out in pain, so he was killed and went to heaven. The second man arrived and showed the king that his ten fruits were berries. When the king explained the trial to the second man, he secretly thought to it would be easy to shove the berries up his butt. On the ninth berry, he burst out in laughter, so he was also was killed and went to heaven. The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one asked, "Why did you laugh? You almost got away with it! " The second one replied, "I know, but I couldn 't help it. I was doin ' just great when all of a sudden the third guy showed up with all those watermelons! ""
