"Two guys were talking at work. "I 've got a problem, " said the first one. "What is it? " "My wife has done it to me again. I 'm supposed to buy my mother-in-law a present for her birthday, from the two of us. And I am fresh out of ideas. I mean it 's HER mother, why can 't she buy it? " "What did you buy her last year? " the other one asked. "Last year I bought her a VERY EXPENSIVE cemetery plot. " "Hmmmm, hard to top that one, " said the other.The two guys couldn 't come up with anything. So the son-in-law didn 't buy his mother-in-law anything for her birthday. When the big day arrived the next weekend, she was a bit upset. At the family gathering for her birthday, she announced out loud to everyone, "Thank you all for the wonderful gifts. Too bad my daughter and son-in-law weren 't so thoughtful! "Thinking quickly, the son-in-law responded, "Well, you haven 't used the gift I gave you last year! ""
