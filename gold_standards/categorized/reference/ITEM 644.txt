"A very shy guy goes into a bar and sees a beautiful woman sitting at the bar. After an hour of gathering up his courage, he finally goes over to her and asks, tentatively, "Um, would you mind if I chatted with you for a while? "She responds by yelling, at the top of her lungs, "NO! I won 't sleep with you tonight! " Everyone in the bar is now staring at them. Naturally, the guy is hopelessly and completely embarrassed and he slinks back to his table.After a few minutes, the woman walks over to him and apologizes. She smiles at him and says, "I 'm sorry if I embarrassed you. You see, I 'm a graduate student in psychology, and I 'm studying how people respond to embarrassing situations. "To which he responds, at the top of his lungs, "What do you mean $200?! ""
