"A mother, father and young son are visiting the circus. The elephants walk out into the circus ring and the little boy says to his mother, "What 's that? " "That 's the elephant 's tail, " she replies. "No, under the tail, " says the youngster. The mother is clearly embarrassed and says, "Oh, nothing. " The boy turns to his father and repeats the same question. His father looks and says, "That 's the elephant 's penis, son. " "So, why did mum say it was nothing? " asks the boy. The father draws himself up to his full height and says, "Son, I guess I 've spoiled that woman. ""
