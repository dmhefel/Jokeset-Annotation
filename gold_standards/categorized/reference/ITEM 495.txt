"Before going to Europe on business, a man drove his Rolls-Royce to a downtown New York City bank and went in to ask for an immediate loan of $5,000. The loan officer, taken aback, requested collateral and so the man said, "Well then, here are the keys to my Rolls-Royce. " The loan officer promptly had the car driven into the bank 's underground parking for safe keeping, and gave him $5,000. Two weeks later, the man walked through the bank 's doors, and asked to settle up his loan and get his car back. "That will be $5,000 in principal, and $15.40 in interest ", the loan officer said. The man wrote out a check and started to walk away. "Wait sir ", the loan officer said, "while you were gone, I found out you are a millionaire. Why in the world would you need to borrow $5,000? " The man smiled. "Where else could I park my Rolls-Royce in Manhattan for two weeks and pay only $15.40?"
