"It is near the end of the school year. The teacher has turned in the grades and there is really nothing more to do. All the children are restless because of this. Teacher: "Whoever answers the questions I ask first and correctly can leave early today. " Little Johnny says to himself, "Good, I want to get outta here. I 'm smart and I 'll answer the question. " Teacher: "Who said 'Four Score and Seven Years Ago '? " Before Johnny can open his mouth, Susie says, "Abraham Lincoln. " Teacher: "That 's right Susie, you can go home. " Johnny is MAD that Susie answered the question first. Teacher: "Who said 'I Have a Dream '? " Before Johnny can open his mouth, Mary says, "Martin Luther King. " Teacher: "That 's right Mary, you can go. " Johnny is even madder than before. Teacher: "Who said 'Ask not, what your country can do for you '? " Before Johnny can open his mouth, Nancy says, "John F. Kennedy. " Teacher: "That 's right Nancy, you may also leave. " Johnny is BOILING mad that he has not been able to answer to any of the questions. When the teacher turns her back Johnny says, "I wish these kids would keep their mouths shut! " The teacher turns around: "NOW WHO SAID THAT?!?! " Johnny: "MICHAEL JACKSON. CAN I GO NOW? ""
