"The owner of a small New York sandwich deli was being questioned by a tax agent about his tax return. He had reported a net profit of $80,000 for the year. "Why don 't you people leave me alone? " the deli owner said. "I work like a dog, everyone in my family helps out, the place is only closed three days a year. And you want to know how I made $80,000? " "It 's not your income that bothers us, " the agent said. "It 's these travel deductions. You listed six trips to Florida for you and your wife. " "Oh, that, " the owner said smiling. "It is a legitimate business expense - we deliver! ""
