"There is a bear chasing a rabbit through the forest and they 're running and running and they stop because a ginnie appears. The ginnie says " if you two stop fighting and chasing each other i 'll give you each three wishes "They agree. The bear wishes first for the biggest "package " of all the bears in the whole forest.And his wish comes true. The rabbit then wishes for an unlimited supply of carrots. His wish is granted too. The bear 's second wish is that all the bears in the forest , except him, are female. Then the rabbit wishes for a motorcycle. The bear 's last wish is that all the bears fall madly in love with him. The rabbit 's final wish is that the bear becomes gay, and the rabbit jumps on his motorcycle and rides away."
