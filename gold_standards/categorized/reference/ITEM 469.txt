"Mr. Smith went to the Doctor 's office to collect his wife 's test results.The receptionist says, "I 'm sorry, sir, but there has been a bit of a mix-up and we have a problem. When we sent the samples from your wife to the lab, the samples from another Mrs. Smith were sent as well and we are now uncertain which one is your wife 's. Frankly, that 's either bad or terrible. " Mr. Smith says, "What do you mean? " The receptionist replies, "Well, one Mrs. Smith has tested positive for Alzheimer disease and the other for AIDS. We cannot tell which is your wife. " Mr Smith exclaims, "That 's terrible! What am I supposed to do now? " The receptionist calmly replies, "The doctor recommends that you drop your wife off in the middle of town and if she finds her way home, don 't go to bed with her. ""
