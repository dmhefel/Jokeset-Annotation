"Jeff and Mike were killed in an accident and as Jeff arrives at the Pearly Gates, he is met by St. Peter. "Where 's my friend Mike? "...Jeff asks the old Saint. St. Peter replies... "Mike wasn 't as fortunate as you, instead of Heaven, he went in the other direction. " Jeff was deeply concerned by this and asks... "well could I see Mike just one more time? " St. Peter agreed to this, so they walked over to the edge of Heaven and looked down.  Jeff notices Mike with a sexy blonde on one side of him and a keg of beer on the other.   "I really don 't mean to complain "...Jeff says... "but Mike seems to have it pretty nice down in Hell. "   "Look a little closer "...says St. Peter... "for that keg has a hole in it, the blonde doesn 't. ""
