"Sandie lost her husband almost four years ago and still has not gotten out of her depression - mourning as if it were only yesterday. Her daughter is constantly calling her and urging her to get back into the world. Finally, Sandie says she 'd go out, but didn 't know anyone. Her daughter immediately replies, "Mama! I have someone for you to meet. " Well, it was an immediate hit. They took to one another and after dating for six weeks he asks her to join him for a weekend in the Catskills. And we know what that meant. Their first night there she undresses as he does. There she stood nude except for a pair of black lacy panties. He in his birthday suit. Looking at her he asks, "Why the black panties? " She replies, "My breasts you can fondle, my body is yours to explore, but down there I am still in mourning. " He knows he 's not getting lucky that night. The following night the same scenario. She 's standing there with the black panties on and he is in his birthday suit; except that he has an erection, on which he has a black condom. She looks at him and asks, "What 's with this...a black condom? " He replies, "I 'd like to offer my condolences. ""
