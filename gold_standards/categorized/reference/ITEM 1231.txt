"A tourist walks into a pet shop in Silicon Valley, and is browsing the cages on display.  While there, a customer walks in and says to the shopkeeper, "I 'll have a C monkey, please ". The shopkeeper nods, goes over to a cage and takes out a monkey. He fits a collar and leash and hands it to the customer, saying "That 'll be $5,000 ". The customer pays and walks out with his monkey. Startled, the tourist says to the shopkeeper. "That was a very expensive monkey--most of them are only a few hundred dollars. Why did that one cost so much? " "Ah, that monkey can program in C--very fast, tight code, no bugs, well worth the money. " The tourist looks at the monkeys in that cage. "That one 's even more expensive $10,000! What does it do? " "Oh, that one 's a C++ monkey; it can manage object-oriented programming, Visual C++, even some Java, all the really useful stuff. " The tourist sees a third monkey in a cage on its own. The price tag round its neck says $50,000. Startled he says to the shopkeeper, "That one costs more than all the others combined! What on earth does it do? " "Well, I don 't know if it does anything, it 's a Consultant. "
