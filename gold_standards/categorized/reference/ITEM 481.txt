"A man staggers into an emergency room with two black eyes and a five iron wrapped tightly around his throat. Naturally the doctor asks him what happened.   "Well, it was like this ", said the man. "I was having a quiet round of golf with my wife when she sliced her ball into a pasture of cows. "   "We went to look for it and while I was rooting around, I noticed one of the cows had something white at its rear end. I walked over and lifted up the tail and sure enough, there was my wife 's golf ball.......... stuck right in the middle of the cow 's butt. That 's when I made my mistake... "   "What did you do? ", asks the doctor.   "Well, I lifted the tail and yelled to my wife, Hey, this looks like yours! "."
