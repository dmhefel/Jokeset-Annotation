"It 's the first day of kindergarten, and the teacher decides to do taste association. 'I 'll blindfold you and give you a lifesaver, and you tell me what flavor it is, ' she tells the children. So she gives them all a cherry flavor, and says, 'What flavor is that? ' The whole class answers 'Mmmm, that 's cherry. ' 'Very good, ' the teacher replies. So she gives them all a grape and they reply, 'Mmm, that 's grape. ' 'Very good, ' she says again. Then she gives them all a honey flavor. The whole class sits perplexed by the strange taste, so the teacher says 'OK, I 'll give you a hint, it 's something your parents might call each other. ' Billy spits his out on the floor and yells, 'Spit 'em out everyone, they 're idiots! '"
