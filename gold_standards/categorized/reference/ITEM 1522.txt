"A young virgin marries a Greek man and before the wedding her father tells her that, being Greek, her husband may ask her to turn the other way in bed one day, but the she doesn 't have to do it if she doesn 't want to. Sure enough, after a couple of months, her husband asks her to turn over and she says "No, my father said I don 't have to do this. " Her husband says OK, that 's fine by me, but I thought you wanted children."
