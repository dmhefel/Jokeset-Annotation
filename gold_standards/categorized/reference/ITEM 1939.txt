"A married man goes to confessional and says to the priest, "Father, I had an affair with a woman... almost. " "What do you mean almost? " question the priest. "Well, we got undressed and rubbed together, but then I stopped. " "Rubbing together is the same as putting it in, " explains the priest. "You 're not to go near that woman again. Now, say five Hail Mary 's and put $50 in the poor box. " The man leaves confessional, says his prayers, and then walks over to the poor box. He pauses for a moment and then decides to leave. The priest quickly runs over to the man and exclaims, "I saw that... you didn 't put any money in the poor box! " "Well Father, I rubbed up against it and, like you said, it 's the same as putting it in! ""
