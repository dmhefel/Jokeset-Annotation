"A few weeks before his death, Orson Welles was talking to his friend and fellow film director Henry Jaglom about Welles ' landmark movie, Citizen Kane. "Make me one promise, " he told Jaglom, "Keep Ted Turner and his goddamned crayolas away from my movie. " Fortunately, when the movie was made, Welles had negotiated a contract with RKO studios giving him complete and absolute control over every aspect of production, including colour u0096 or lack thereof. Although he wanted to, Turner never got a chance to colourize Citizen Kane."
