"A man who just got a raise decides to buy a new scope for his rifle. He goes to a rifle shop, and asks the clerk to show him a scope. The clerk takes out a scope, and says to the man, "This scope is so good, you can see my house all the way up on that hill. " The man takes a look through the scope, and starts laughing. "What 's so funny? " asks the clerk. "I see a naked man and a naked woman running around in the house. " the man replies. The clerk grabs the scope from the man, and looks at his house. Then he hands two bullets to the man and says, "Here are two bullets, I 'll give you this scope for nothing if you take these two bullets, shoot my wife 's head off and shoot the guy 's privates off. " The man takes another look through the scope and says, "You know what? I think I can do that with one shot! ""
