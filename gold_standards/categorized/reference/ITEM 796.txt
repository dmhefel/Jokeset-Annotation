"An elderly couple were driving across the country. The woman was driving when she got pulled over by the highway patrol. The officer said, "Ma 'am did you know you were speeding? " The woman, hard of hearing, turns to her husband and asks, "What did he say? " The old man yells, "He says you were speeding! " The patrolman says, "May I see your license?

" The woman turned to her husband and asked, "What did he say? " And the old man yells, "He said he knows you! "."
