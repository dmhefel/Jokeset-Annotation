"Three Pastors in the south were having lunch in a diner. One said "You know, since summer started I 've been having trouble with bats in my loft and attic at church.  I 've tried everything--noise, spray, cats--nothing seems to scare them away. " Another said "Yeah, me too.  I 've got hundreds living in my belfry.  I 've even had the place fumigated, and they won 't go away. " The third said, "I baptized all mine, and made them members of the church...  Haven 't seen one back since!!! "
