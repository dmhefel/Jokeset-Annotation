"A man who had been in a mental home for some years finally seemed to have improved to the point where it was thought he might be released. The head of the institution, in a fit of commendable caution, decided, however, to interview him first. "Tell me, " said he, "if we release you, as we are considering doing, what do you intend to do with your life? ' The inmate said, "It would be wonderful to get back to real life and if I do, I will certainly refrain from making my former mistake. I was a nuclear physicist, you know, and it was the stress of my work in weapons research that helped put me here. If I am released, I shall confine myself to work in pure theory, where I trust the situation will be less difficult and stressful. " "Marvelous, " said the head of the institution. "Or else, " ruminated the inmate. "I might teach. There is something to be said for spending one 's life in bringing up a new generation of scientists. " "Absolutely, " said the head. "Then again, I might write. There is considerable need for books on science for the general public. Or I might even write a novel based on my experiences in this fine institution. " "An interesting possibility, " said the head. "And finally, if none of these things appeals to me, I can always continue to be a teakettle.quot;"
