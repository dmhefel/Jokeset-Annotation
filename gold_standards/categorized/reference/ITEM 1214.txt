"A US Commerce Department Employee sits in his office and out of boredom, decides to see what 's in his old filing cabinet. He pokes through the contents and comes across an old brass lamp. "This will look nice on my mantelpiece, " he decides, and takes it home with him.While polishing the lamp, a genie appears and grants him three wishes. "I wish for an ice cold diet Pepsi right now! "He gets his Pepsi and drinks it.Now that he can think more clearly, he states his second wish. "I wish to be on an island where beautiful nymphomaniacs reside. " Suddenly he is on an island with gorgeous females eyeing him lustfully.He eagerly gives the genie his third and final wish: "I wish I 'd never have to work ever again. "POOF! He 's back in his government office."
