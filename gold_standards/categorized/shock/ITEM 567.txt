"A man enters a cafe, sits down &amp; notices that the special of the day is cold chili. When the waitress comes to take his order, he says, "I 'll take the cold chili. " "I 'm sorry, the gentlemen next to you got the last bowl, " says the waitress. "Oh. I 'll just have coffee, then. " After a while the man notices that the guy next to him who got the last bowl of cold chili is finishing a rather large meal and the chili bowl is still full. He asks, "Are you going to eat that? " The other man replies, "No. " "Would you sell it to me? " "You can have it for free if you want it. " So the man takes the bowl of chili and begins to eat it. When he gets about half way through the bowl, he notices a dead mouse in the bowl and pukes the chili back into the bowl. The other man says sympathetically, "That 's about as far as I got, too. ""
