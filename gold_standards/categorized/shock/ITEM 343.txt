"A mother took her little boy to church. While in church the little boy said, "Mommy, I have to pee. " The mother said to the little boy, "It 's not appropriate to say the word 'pee ' in church. So, from now on whenever you have to 'pee ' just tell me that you have to 'whisper '. " The following Sunday, the little boy went to church with his father and during the service said to his father, "Daddy, I have to whisper. " The Father looked at him and said, "Okay, why don 't you whisper in my ear. ""
