"Three old ladies are sitting in the park on a beautiful spring day feeding the pigeons and the squirrels, when suddenly, a man in a long trench coat jumps in front of them and throws open his coat. He 's completely naked under his jacket. The three old ladies haven 't seen such a thing in a very long time, and their blood pressure shoots up quickly. The first old lady lets out a gasp and has a stroke. The second old lady sees this and it 's too much for her, she gasps and has a stroke, too. The third old lady didn 't have a stroke, she was sitting too far away and couldn 't reach."
