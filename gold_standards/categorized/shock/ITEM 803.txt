"Two 80 year old men sat talking over the weather and the latest in medical science, and such, when one brings up the latest male medical miracle, Viagra. The other wasn 't familiar with Viagra and asked the first man what it was for. The first man said, "It 's the greatest thing I 've ever known. The Fountain of Youth!! Makes you feel like a man of 30! " The second then asked, "Can you get it over the counter? " "You probably could, if you took two pills ", said the first man."
