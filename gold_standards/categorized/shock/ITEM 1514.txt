"A little girl is in line to see Santa. When it 's her turn, she climbs up on Santa 's lap. "What would you like Santa to bring you for Christmas? " Santa asks. "I want a Barbie and Xena, " the little girl replies. Santa looks at the little girl for a moment and says, "I thought Barbie comes with Ken. " "No, " the little girl says. "She comes with Xena. She fakes it with Ken. "
