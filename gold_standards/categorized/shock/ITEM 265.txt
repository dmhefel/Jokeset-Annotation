"An older couple are playing in the annual club championship. They are playing in a playoff hole and it is down to a 6 inch putt that the wife has to make. She takes her stance and her husband can see her trembling. She putts and misses, they lose the match. On the way home in the car her husband is fuming, "I can 't believe you missed that putt! " "That putt was no longer than my 'willy '. "The wife just looked over at her husband and smiled and said, "yes dear, but it was much harder! "."
