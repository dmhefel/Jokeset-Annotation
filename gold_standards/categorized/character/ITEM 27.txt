"A blonde walks into a pharmacy and asks the pharmacist for a bottom deodorant.   "Sorry, we don 't sell bottom deodorant " the pharmacist replies, struggling to keep from laughing. "But I always buy it here ", the blonde says. "I bought one last month ". Thinking quickly, the pharmacist suggests, " I don 't know what you bought before, may be you can bring in the empty container next time ". "Sure ", the blonde replies. "I 'll bring it with me tomorrow "The next day, the blonde walks into the shop again and hands the pharmacist an almost empty deodorant stick. "This is just a normal deodorant ", the pharmacist tells the blonde, "You use it under your arms ". "No, it is not ", the blonde answers, "it says so here: To apply, push up bottom "."
