"One day two blondes each bought a pig.  The problem they were having was telling the two pigs apart.  So, the first blonde had an idea: She said, "I 'll cut my pig 's tail off, then we will know the difference. " So she cut her pig 's tail off.  That night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig 's tail off.  The next morning the blonde had a solution, she said, "I 'll just cut my pig 's right back leg off. " So, she did.  That night same thing; the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig 's right back leg off.  The next morning the blondes were real upset and finally decided to cut the back left leg from the pig, so she did.  That night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig 's back left leg off.  The next morning the blondes were really upset and didn 't know how they were going to tell their pigs apart.  So, one of them stated, "I will cut my pig 's right front leg off. Then we can tell our pigs apart. " So, she did.  That night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig 's right front leg off.  The blondes were really upset and decided the only logical explanation would be to cut the remaining leg off one pig. So, they did.  That night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig 's only leg off.  The next morning when the blondes awoke they were devastated.  Finally, the other blonde spoke up and said,   "How about you take the white one and I 'll take the black one. ""
