"A fellow walks into a bar, orders a drink, and asks the bartender if he 'd like to hear a good Notre Dame joke. "Listen buddy, " he growled. "See those 2 big guys on your left? They were both linemen on the Notre Dame football team. And that huge fellow on your right was a world-class wrestler at Notre Dame. That guy in the corner was Notre Dame 's all-time champion weight lifter. And I lettered in 3 sports at Notre Dame. Now, are you absolutely positive you want to go ahead and tell your joke here? " "Nah, guess not, " the man replied. "I wouldn 't want to have to explain it 5 times. ""
