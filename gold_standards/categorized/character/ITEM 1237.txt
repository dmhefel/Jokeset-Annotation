"A young ventriloquist is touring the South and stops to entertain at a  bar in Texas. He 's going through his usual stupid Redneck jokes,when a big burly guy  in the audience stands up and says "I 've heard just about enough of your  damn hillbilly jokes; we ain 't all stupid here in the South. " Flustered, the ventriloquist begins to apologize, when the big guy pipes  up,   "You stay out of this mister, I 'm talking to the little wise-guy  on your knee! ""
