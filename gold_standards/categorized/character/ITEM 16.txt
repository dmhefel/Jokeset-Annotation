"A lawyer and a blonde are sitting next to each other on a long flight from LA to NY.The lawyer leans over to her and asks if she would like to play a fun game. The blonde just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains " I ask you a question, and if you don 't know the answer, you pay me $5, and vice-versa. " Again, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now somewhat agitated, says, "Okay, if you don 't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don 't know the answer that you 'll ask me, I will pay you $500!. " Figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match. This catches the blonde 's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. "What 's the distance from the earth to the moon? " The blonde doesn 't say a word, reaches in to her purse, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it 's the blonde 's turn. She asks the lawyer: "What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four? " The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references.He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends E-mails to all his coworkers and friends he knows. All to no avail. Afterover an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $500. The blonde politely takes the $500 and turns away to get back to sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, so what IS the answer!? " Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep."
