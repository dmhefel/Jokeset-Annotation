She went and asked a neighbour for some help "I can 't tell these horses apart " she said.The neighbour told her to cut the tail of one of them off. So the blonde cut off the tail, and that worked great until the other one got it 's tail cut off too. So, the blonde goes and tells the neighbour "I can u2019t tell them apart again! u201d.Well says the neighbour u201cTry cutting off the tip of one of the horses ears. u201d So the blonde cuts off the tip of the ear. That also worked great until the other one got a part of it 's ear cut off. The Blonde goes back to the neighbour and tells him what happened. The neighbour says well measure them that will work for sure. It worked a treat since the white one was 6 inches taller than the black one!"
