"A cop was driving down a country road when he saw a car in the ditch. He got out of his car to see if anyone was in the car. A blonde popped her head out the window and said "Thank god officer! I got in an accident! " The officer replied with "Well I can see that! Are you okay? " The blonde looked forward and said "Well yeah... I think so. " Then the officer looked around and said "Miss.... your car looks like an elephant stepped on it. How did you crash? " The blonde looked at him and said "It was so strange. I was driving down the road and out of nowhere a tree jumped infront of me, so I swerved to the other side and another tree was in the way, so I swerved again, but another one was there again, so one last time I swerved to the other side, but the damn tree got me, and caused me to go in this ditch! " The officer started to laugh hard. "Whats so funny? " The blonde asked. The officer took a second to catch his breath then said "Miss, theres no trees on this road for miles ahead. That was your car air freshner swinging back and forth! ""
