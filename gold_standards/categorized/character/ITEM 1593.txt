"A blonde tried to sell her old car. She was having a lot of problems selling it, because the car had 250,000 miles on it. One day, she spoke about her problem with a brunette she worked with at a salon. The brunette told her, "There is a possibility to make the car easier to sell, but it 's not legal. " "That doesn 't matter, " replied the blonde, "as long as I can sell the car. " "Okay, " said the brunette. "Here is the address of a friend of mine. He owns a car repair shop. Tell him I sent you and he will turn the counter in your car back to 50,000 miles. Then it shouldn 't be problem to sell it anymore. " The following weekend, the blonde made the trip to the mechanic. About one month after that, the brunette asked the blonde, "Did you sell your car? " "No, " replied the blonde, "why should I? It only has 50,000 miles on it. ""
