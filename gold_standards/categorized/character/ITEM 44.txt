"This blonde decides one day that she is sick and tired of all these blonde jokes and how all blondes are perceived as stupid, so she decides to show her husband that blondes really are smart. While her husband is off at work, she decides that she is going to paint a couple of rooms in the house. The next day, right after her husband leaves for work, she gets down to the task at hand. Her husband arrives home at 5:30 and smells the distinctive smell of paint. He walks into the living room and finds his wife lying on the floor in a pool of sweat. He notices that she is wearing a ski jacket and a fur coat at the same time. "Honey, are you okay? " he asks her. "Yes " she replies. "Then what are you doing? " he asks. "I wanted to prove to you that not all blonde women are dumb and I wanted to do it by painting the house. " she replies. "Then why are you wearing a ski jacket over a fur coat? " he asks. "Well, " she replies "I was reading the directions on the paint can and it said..... FOR BEST RESULTS, PUT ON TWO COATS. ""
