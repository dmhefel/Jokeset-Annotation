"A blonde walks into an appliance store and starts to look around. She then asks the clerk, "Can I have that television set over there. " The clerk looks at her and says no. This confuses her. She then asks why? The Clerk responds, "Because you are a blonde. " The blonde woman walks out with an idea on how to get that television. She then returns with a wig full of red hair. She asks the clerk again for the television set. He looks at her suspiciously and replies, "No because I told you I don 't sell them to blondes. " She then says, "I am not a blonde I am a redhead. " The clerk then said, "I know you're the same women because that is no television thats a microwave. "
