"A Blonde and a Burnette are watching the news at 6. It is live on the scene. It has been reported that a old homeless man is on top of a large bridge and swears that he will jump off the bridge. The Burnette turns around and says to the Blonde " I bet you $50 that he will jump. Th blonde says " You 're on. Sure enough the old man jumps and falls to his death. The Burnette snickers to herself and says "I must admit I did watch the news at 5. The blonde says So did I but, I did 'nt think he would jump twice!!"
