"This blonde goes to the Western Union office and says, "I just have to get an urgent message to my mother in Europe. " The clerk says it will be $100, and she replies "But I don 't have any money.... and I must get a message to her, it 's urgent!... I 'll do anything to get a message to her. " The clerk replies "Anything? ". "Yes.... ANYTHING! " replies the blonde. He leads her back to his office and closes the door. He tells her to kneel in front of him. "Unzip me... " She does. "Take it out..... go ahead. " She does this as well. She looks up at him, his member in her hands and he says "Well... go ahead... do it... " She brings her lips close to it and shouts "Hello?... Mom? ""
