"One cold Winter day, a blonde decides she wants to take up ice fishing. When she gets to the pond, she begins to cut a hole in the ice. As she does, she hears a voice. "There 's no fish there... ".    Puzzled, the blonde picks up her stuff and cuts another hole a few feet away. Again, she hears the voice. "There 's no fish there... "    The blonde is confused, but still determined. About 10 feet away, she begins to cut another ice hole. "There 's no fish there... ", she hears.    She immediately turns her head to the sky and says, "Is that you, God? " "NO! IT 'S THE MANAGER OF THE ICE-SKATING RINK! THERE 'S NO FISH THERE! ""
