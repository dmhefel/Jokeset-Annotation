"This guy goes to sit at his plane seat in first class, and finds a blonde there. He says, excuse me miss, but this is my seat. She replies, I 'm blonde, I 'm beautiful, I have a great body and I 'm going to Florida. So the guy calls the stewardess over to help him. He explains the situation to the stewardess, and the stewardess says, miss, your seat is in coach, I 'm gonna have to ask you to leave first class. The blonde response, I 'm blonde, I 'm beautiful, I have a  great body, and I 'm going to Florida. The stewardess then goes to get the captain to help her, and the captain asks the blonde to please leave first class, and go back to coach.  The blonde response, I 'm blonde, I 'm beautiful, I have a great body, and I 'm going to Florida. The captain thinks about this for a minute, then whispers something in  the blondes ear. As soon as he does, she gets up and goes back to  coach.. The stewardess is amazed. What did you say?  The captain replies, I told her first class doesn 't go to Florida."
