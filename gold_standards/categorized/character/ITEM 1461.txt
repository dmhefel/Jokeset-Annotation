"a blonde goes to an electronic store. She goes up to the salesman and says " I 'd like to buy this TV " the salesman replies "sorry I don 't sell to blondes " the blonde, very angry goes home. The next day she dresses up very professionally, pins her hair up and puts on a pair of glasses. She goes back to the store and says to the same salesman "I 'd like to buy this TV " The salesman again says "sorry but I don 't sell to blondes " Now the blonde is very angry. The next day she dyes her hair brown and puts on the glasses and goes back to the store. Again she says to the salesman "I 'd like to buy this TV " and again the salesman replies "Sorry I don 't sell to blondes " The blonde starts yelling "I 'm not blonde, look my hair is brown. Why won 't you just sell be the damn TV? " The salesman replies "Because it 's a microwave "."
