"A lawyer married a woman who had previously divorced ten husbands. On their wedding night, she told her new husband, "Please be gentle, I 'm still a virgin. " "What? " said the puzzled groom. "How can that be if you 've been married ten times? " "Well, Husband #1 was a sales representative; he kept telling me how great it was going to be. Husband #2 was in software services; he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he 'd look into it and get back to me. Husband #3 was from field services; he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn 't get the system up. Husband #4 was in telemarketing; even though he knew he had the order, he didn 't know when he would be able to deliver. Husband #5 was an engineer; he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method. Husband #6 was from finance and administration; he thought he knew how, but he wasn 't sure whether it was his job or not. Husband #7 was in marketing; although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it. Husband #8 was a psychologist; all he ever did was talk about it. Husband #9 was a gynecologist; all he did was look at it. Husband #10 was a stamp collector; all he ever did was... God! I miss him! But now that I 've married you, I 'm really excited! " "Good, " said the new husband, "but, why? " "You 're a lawyer. This time I know I 'm gonna get screwed! ""
