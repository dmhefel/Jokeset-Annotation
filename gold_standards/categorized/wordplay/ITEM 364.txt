"A psychiatrist was conducting a group therapy session with four young mothers and their small children... "You all have obsessions, " he observed. To the first mother, Mary, he said, "You are obsessed with eating. You 've even named your daughter Candy. " He turned to the second Mom, Ann: "Your obsession is with money. Again, it manifests itself in your child 's name, Penny. " He turns to the third Mom, Joyce: "Your obsession is alcohol. This too manifests itself in your child 's name, Brandy. " At this point, the fourth mother, Kathy, gets up, takes her little boy by the hand and whispers. "Come on, Dick, we 're leaving. "
