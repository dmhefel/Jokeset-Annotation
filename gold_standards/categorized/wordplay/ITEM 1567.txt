"A man moved to an unfamaliar area and was very lonely.So he decides to buy some pets.He went walking into town and noticed a man selling chickens.He went up to the man and said: "I 'll take one hen and one rooster. " The man gladly sold him the birds but warned: "Sure sir, but just be advised we call them cocks and pullets around here, not roosters and hens. " The man joyfully left with his two new pets and decided to buy one more.So he came up to a man selling donkeys. "I 'll take that donkey " he said, pointing a particularly healthy looking donkey. "Sure sir, but first of all we call them asses around here, not donkeys, and this particular one is pecuilar.She will stop walking after a while, but if she does, just scratch her on the back and she will start back up again. " So the man bought the donkey and went on his way home.Sure enough, the donkey stopped walking after a while.The man had his hands full with the birds, so he couldn 't scratch her.Luckily, a woman walked by.The man looked at her and smiled saying: "Will you please hold my cock and pull it while I scratch my ass!
