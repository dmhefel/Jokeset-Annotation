"Jack was going to be married to Jill, so his father sat him down for a little fireside chat. He said, "Jack, let me tell you something. On my wedding night in our honeymoon suite, I took off my trousers and handed them to your mother, and said, 'Here - try these on. ' So, she did, and said, 'These are too big,I can 't wear them. 'So I replied, 'Exactly. I wear the trousers in this family, and I always will. 'Ever since that night, we have never had any problems. " "Hmmm, " said Jack. He thought that might be a good thing to try, so on his honeymoon, Jack took off his trousers and said to Jill, "Here, try these on. " So she did and said, "These are too large, they don 't fit me. " So Jack said, "Exactly. I wear the trousers in this family, and I always will, and I don 't want you to ever forget that. " Then Jill took off her knickers and handed them to Jack and said, "Here, you try on mine. "So he did, and said, "I can 't get into your pants. " So Jill said, "Exactly. And if you don 't change your attitude, you never will. ""
