"Steven Spielberg was discussing his new project - an action docudrama about famous composers starring top movie stars. Sylvester Stallone, Steven Seagall, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger were all present. Spielberg strongly desired the box office 'oomph ' of these superstars, so he was prepared to allow them to select whatever composers they would portray, as long as they were very famous. "Well, " started Stallone, "I 've always admired Mozart. I would love to play him. " "Chopin has always been my favorite, and my image would improve if people saw me playing the piano " said Willis. "I 'll play him. " "I 've always been partial to Strauss and his waltzes, " said Seagall. "I 'd like to play him. "Spielberg was very pleased with these choices. "Sounds splendid. " Then, looking at Schwarzenegger, he asked, "Who do you want to be, Arnold? "So Arnold says, "I 'll be Bach. "
