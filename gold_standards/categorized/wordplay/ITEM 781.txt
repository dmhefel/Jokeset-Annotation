"A penguin is driving through Arizona on a hot summer 's day when he notices his oil light is on. He gets out of the car and, sure enough, it 's leaking oil all over the road. The penguin drives around the corner to a service station and asks the mechanic to take a look at it. The mechanic says he has a few others to look at first but if he comes back in an hour he can tell the penguin what is wrong with his car. The penguin agrees and goes for a walk. He finds an ice cream shop and thinks a big bowl of vanilla ice cream will really hit the spot since he 's a penguin and it 's Arizona in the summer, after all. He sits down at the counter and starts in on his ice cream. Of course he has no hands so it is rather messy. By the time he is done he has ice cream all over his flippers and his mouth - a total mess. He walks back to the service station and says to the mechanic, "Did you find out what is wrong with my car? " The mechanic replies, "It looks like you 've blown a seal. " "No, no, " says the penguin. "It 's just ice cream, I swear!!! ""
