"PISTON BROKE One late evening, a redneck named Leroy came out of the local pub a little drunk. He got into his pickup truck and started driving home. He was on a lonely stretch of road when all of a sudden a piston blew right through the engine hood. Leroy gets out of his pickup, angry as 'hell ' and kicks the door real hard and starts walking down the lonely road. About 20 minutes later, a pickup truck with a bunch of fellow rednecks riding in the back of the truck came along and stopped. One of the fella 's called out, "Hey what 's the matter Leroy? " Leroy answers, "Piston-broke! " The same fella calls back, "Ya, we 're pissed'n broke too. Get in the truck! ""
