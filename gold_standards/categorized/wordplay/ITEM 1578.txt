One of the cowboys looks at her and says, "Kin ya swaller? " The woman shakes her head, no. "Kin ya breathe? " The woman begins to turn blue and shakes her head.

As she begins to breathe again, the cowboy walks slowly back to the bar and takes a drink from his beer. His partner says, "Ya know, I 'd heard of that there "Hind Lick maneuver ", but I ain 't never seen nobody do it before. ""
