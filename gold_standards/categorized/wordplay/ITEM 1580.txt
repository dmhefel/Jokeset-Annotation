"There was a construction foreman looking for laborers, he posted an ad in the local newspaper a short time later a stout Norweigan man named Bjorn showed up an said "Herlo job foreman sir, when do I start the yob? ".Knowing the Norweigan was probably dumb as a post he decided to test the lad so he told the man "without using any numbers I want you to make nine " the Norweigan looked around and picked up a stick and proceeded to draw three trees in the dirt, "there ya go job foreman guy when do I start? "Annoyed, the forman replied "How do you figure that makes nine? " "Well tree plus tree plus tree makes nine. ", "Yeah, okay smart guy, " retorted the foreman, "now without using any numbers make ninety nine. " So without skipping a beat, the Norweigan grabbed, a shovel and scooped up some mud and proceeded to drop a dollop of mud on each tree, "there ya go foreman guy when do I start? "Infuriated at this point that the man was so quick, he asked "How 's that ninety nine? " "Well ya see, dirty tree plus dirty tree plus dirty tree isa ninety nine. " "Make one hundred " demanded the foreman, positive that there was no way neandrathal Norweigan could oblige. Once again the man used the shovel this time scooping up a pile of dog poop, evenly dropping a bit under each tree, "OK! job foreman guy, where do you want me to be startin first? " "Alright wise-guy, explain how the heck is that to make 100? " "Okay, " said the witty Norweigan,   "dirty tree and a tird plus dirty tree and a tird plus dirty tree and a tird dat makes 100! ""
